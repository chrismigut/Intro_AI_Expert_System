###CAP 5625: Introduction to the Artificial Intelligence 

#####Project 2: Expert Systems 

#####Due: Sunday 12/06/15
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Build an expert system using CLIPS. You can work with one partner. 
- You may choose the area of expertise of your expert system.
- Review the CLIPS documentation provided in CLIPS tutorial. Install CLIPS and run some examples to get familiar with the language and the programming environment. 

##1. Minimum Requirements: 
To ensure some uniformity on the works done by all groups, your expert system must meet the following minimum requirements: 

- 1. Include **at least** two objects defined as instances of two different classes. 
- 2. Include **at least** 20 rules. Approximately half of these rules should be referring to attributes of two different objects. 
- 3. **Get input from user** – these rules are not included in the count for requirement 2. 
 

##2. Grading Guidelines 

READ THE GRADING CRITERIA CAREFULLY SO YOU DON’T LOSE POINTS. 

- 50% Technical Quality: 
  * 30% - System performs correctly: asks the user the correct questions, knows when to stop searching, and reaches the correct conclusion.
  * 10% - Completeness and accuracy of the knowledge base in the system. 
  * 10% - Originality and usefulness of your expert system. 
	
	
- 25% Documentation: 
  * 5% - Clean, well-organized and neat code. 
  * 3% - Clear instructions on how to run your program. 
  * 2% - Description of your expert system: what it does and how it works. Including a brief description to the user at the start program about what the expert system will do for the user. 
  * 15% - Well written, meaningful comments throughout the whole code including comments before each of the rules/objects stating what the rule/object does. 
	
 - 25% Usability: User interface that is easy to use and intuitive.
  * 10% - Easy to understand questions and messages to the user. 
  * 10% - Status information showing conclusions made by the expert system as it runs. 
  * 5% - Error checking on user input. 

- **10% Bonus: The 3 best projects will be awarded a bonus up to 10%.**  


- You can earn at most 25% of the total point (documentation) if the program does not run.  In case of any problem during the execution, the TA will contact the group to come in person and present the project. 

**Note on Plagiarism:** Your program must be your original work. Any portion of code that is not your own work must be referenced, giving the appropriate credit to the author. 

The TA’s PC will be used for grading your program.

##3. Submission: 
Please submit your project online through canvas. Please submit a zipped file including all of your project files and a .txt file containing your group name, description about your expert system, and how to use and run the program.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##The application has the following features:
- logging (reading/writing), 
- switch statements, 
- loops,
- 2 : Objects
- 6 : Classes
- 6 : Event-handlers, 
- 5 : Functions, 
- 21: Rules

###Final Project Grade: 110 out of 100
