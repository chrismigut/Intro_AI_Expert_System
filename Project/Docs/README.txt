DESCRIPTION:
	This expert system was created with my fleet (clan) in mind. 
		The primary purpose of the system was created for Systems United Navy (SUN)
		We process a large number of reports in a given month. From either relating to 
		tranfers of people between subgroups to those relating to enforcement of rules.
		We have around 150 some people in my clan. The amount of processing of reports 
		takes good amound of time (1-2 weeks) to process. 
		Part of this time is training people to process these reports.

	This expert system was build with their oversight in some of their basic needs. It was built as 
		a testbed. There is a module that allows CLIPS to work with python. This will allow
		us to contiue explanding this testbed. There is a general goal to have an 
		a expert system to process reports by end of next year. Unless something happens between
		now and then. 
	
	I have learned from this project,
		-> How to process rules
		-> How to use message handlers
		-> How to write and read files 
		-> How to mange different objects
	
	I would rewrite the system based on the current knownledge I know.
	There is still many errors that could be improved on with this expert system.

HOW TO USE:
	* Download the CLIPS .CLP file and save inside a folder. 
	* Start CLIPS	
	* Load .CLP file 
	* During the execution a number of files will be created in that folder
