Statement of Purpose: 
------------------------------
  The goal of this expert system is to recommendation course of actions relating to 
  based on the type of report submitted. The permission level of the user 
  will determin which reports the user can view. 
  The primary purpose of the system was created for Systems United Navy (SUN)
  incident reporting. This system is built as a testbed to see what CLIPS can do. 
  If the system proves to be somewhat useful, there is an addons that allows CLIPS 
  code to be used with ptyhon. 

******************************
System Description : 
------------------------------
  This is a forward-chaining expert system using CLIPS. 
  Foward-chaining takes a series of facts given to return a finial result. 
  The facts are provided by the user as enter input or from a file. 
  In this system will be expecting the user to enter input into the terminal.

******************************
How the System works : 
------------------------------
  The system will ask the user a series of questions.
  Based on those questions, the user will be able to access different
  functions relating to the sytem based on their permission level. 
  For example, an officer of the fleet will have access to more reports 
  then that of a non-officer. We assume that an officer is an admin in general. 
  Upon the final question asked by the system, will return a result.
